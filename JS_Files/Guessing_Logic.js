/*
We are building a guessing game that will have the following functionality:

Program generates a random number at the start of each game
User's goal is to guess the correct number
User gets a set # of tries (default = 5)
Program tracks user's guesses and prevents duplicate guessing
Game ends when user guesses correctly or runs out of tries
